Lossless media compression, EXIF/IPTC/XMP metadata sync, Schema.org JSON-LD, XML sitemaps, Open Graph, and broken link checker.

== Description ==

**Metamanager** manages metadata at two layers of your WordPress stack — the media files themselves and your web presence.

**Media layer** — lossless compression for images, video, and audio; bidirectional metadata sync between WordPress fields and embedded file tags (EXIF/IPTC/XMP, ID3, QuickTime atoms, Vorbis comments); PDF metadata import; GPS import; write-back verification — all via OS-level daemons using ExifTool and ffmpeg.

**Web layer** — per-post/page/term/user title and description control; Open Graph and Twitter/X card output; Schema.org JSON-LD for 20+ types; XML sitemaps (pages, media, video); HTML sitemap shortcode; robots.txt management; async broken link checker; business profile with contact card block; author profiles with structured data.

= Requirements =

This plugin requires OS-level tools installed on the server:

* **ExifTool** — metadata embedding
* **jpegtran** — lossless JPEG compression
* **optipng** — lossless PNG compression
* **cwebp** — lossless WebP compression
* **ffmpeg** — video remux
* **systemd** — daemon management

Use the bundled `metamanager-install.sh` script to install everything automatically on Ubuntu/Debian or RHEL/Rocky Linux.

= Features =

**Media:**

* Lossless compression: JPEG (jpegtran), PNG (optipng), WebP (cwebp -lossless)
* EXIF/IPTC/XMP metadata written simultaneously via ExifTool
* ID3 tags for MP3, QuickTime atoms for MP4/M4A, Vorbis comments for OGG/FLAC
* PDF title, author, keywords imported on upload; XMP written back
* Bidirectional sync: embedded tags populate WP fields on upload; WP edits written back to file
* GPS coordinates imported from EXIF; included in Schema.org ImageObject
* Write-back verification after daemon embedding
* Bulk compress all unprocessed attachments
* Expanded metadata fields: Creator, Copyright, Owner, Headline, Credit, Keywords, Date, Rating, City, State, Country

**Web / SEO:**

* Per-post/page/term/user title and description with template tokens
* Open Graph: og:title, og:description, og:image (with dimensions/type/alt), og:video, og:audio, article timestamps; Twitter/X cards
* Schema.org JSON-LD: Article, BlogPosting, WebPage, BreadcrumbList, ImageObject, VideoObject, AudioObject, DigitalDocument, Product, FAQPage, HowTo, Recipe, Event, Course, JobPosting, Review, Service, Organization, LocalBusiness, Person — 20+ types
* XML sitemaps: /sitemap.xml, /sitemap-media.xml, /sitemap-video.xml with ping on publish
* HTML sitemap via [mm_sitemap] shortcode
* Robots.txt: auto-appended Sitemap: directives; global per-type noindex; per-post robots controls
* Async broken link checker with HTTP codes, dashboard view, email alerts, re-check, and ignore
* Link hygiene: global nofollow/noopener/target=_blank rules for external links
* Business profile: name, address, contact, hours, geo — powers LocalBusiness JSON-LD, Gutenberg block, sameAs social links
* Author profiles: job title, bio, social links; Person JSON-LD on author archives

== Installation ==

= Automatic (standard WordPress install) =

1. Search for "Metamanager" in your WordPress dashboard under Plugins → Add New.
2. Click Install Now, then Activate.

= Manual server install =

For servers where the OS-level tools (ExifTool, jpegtran, etc.) are not yet installed:

1. On your server: `wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardkentgates/metamanager/main/metamanager-install.sh | sudo bash`
2. The script installs all dependencies, copies the plugin, and starts the daemons.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work on shared hosting? =

The SEO features (metadata panels, Open Graph, Schema.org, sitemaps, link checker) work on any WordPress host. The media compression and metadata embedding features require OS-level tools (ExifTool, jpegtran, etc.) which are typically only available on VPS or dedicated servers.

= What image formats are supported for lossless compression? =

JPEG (jpegtran), PNG (optipng), and WebP (cwebp -lossless). GIF and AVIF are not currently supported.

= Does compression affect image quality? =

No. The plugin uses only lossless methods — jpegtran's lossless optimisation, optipng's deflate recompression, and cwebp's -lossless flag. Pixel data is unchanged.

= Can I use just the SEO features without the compression daemons? =

Yes. All web/SEO features are fully functional without the OS daemons. Jobs are queued but simply won't execute until the daemons are running.
